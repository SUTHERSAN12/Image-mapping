# Image-mapping
This website is created using image mapping.
 An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
To create an image map you need an image and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.

Here I created using the world map, if you select a particular continent it shows details about that continent.
